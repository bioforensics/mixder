Description: A workflow for performing SNP mixture deconvolution of ForenSeq Kintelligence SNPs. Mixture deconvolution is performed using EuroForMix (https://github.com/oyvble/euroformix/). After mixture deconvolution, the user can choose to calculate metrics such as genotype accuracy and heterozygosity for a range of allele probability thresholds (useful for validation work) or create GEDmatch PRO reports utilizing specified allele probability thresholds.
